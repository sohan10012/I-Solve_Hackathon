# Carpooling Website

## Project Overview
This project is a basic working website for carpooling, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a JSON file as the backend for data fetching. The website allows users to find and book rides, facilitating a virtual carpooling network for employees of large companies or organizations.

## Features

- **Book a Ride**: Users can book a ride from the available options.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy navigation and use.

## Problem Statement
